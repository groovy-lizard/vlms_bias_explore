# VLMs Bias Explorer

This repo aims to explore social and computational bias in VLMs, especially CLIP and those derived from it. There is a package that can generate embeddings, evaluate over a classification task and save a report of the performance. More instructions e-mail me at [lmceschini@inf.ufrgs.br](lmceschini@inf.ufrgs.br).

## Possible Experiments

By leveraging the capabilities of multiple backbones and data sources, we can think of a variety of possible experiments.

- Impact of datasources
- Impact of backbones
